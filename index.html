    <h1>Zombot Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 8/11/2023</p>
    <h2>Proper Usage</h2>
    <p>Zombot is used for viewing player statistics for the Zombies gamemode on the Hypixel Minecraft server. You may use all the available commands within your server, so long as doing so does not break Discord's TOS.</p>
    <p>
        Zombot stores user IDs for all users that have used any of it's commands. It also stores guild IDs for each server that it has been added to. These IDs are stored in order to keep track of command usage stats.
        If you want your data deleted or have any questions, please contact the bot creator:
